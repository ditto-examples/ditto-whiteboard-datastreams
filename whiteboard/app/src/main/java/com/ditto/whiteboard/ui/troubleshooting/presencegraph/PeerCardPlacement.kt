 * Where to put an expanded peer card: **centred in the viewport**.
 *
 * The card used to be anchored to its peer, which meant it sat wherever that peer
 * happened to be — including hard against an edge, where the parent's `clipToBounds()`
 * cut off the bottom rows. Those are the sync rows, which are the whole reason the card
 * exists. Centring removes the failure mode entirely rather than papering over it with
 * flip-and-clamp rules, and it also means the card no longer has to chase its node
 * during a pan or a pinch.
 *
 * The trade is that the card covers the middle of the graph, which is where the focused
 * peer sits. That is acceptable for a modal inspector — the graph is still there when
 * the card closes, and the peer's pill is highlighted underneath.
 *
 * Pure, no Compose types, so it is unit-testable on the JVM like the layout engine.
 * A card larger than the viewport pins to the margin and is expected to scroll rather
 * than overflow; see the height cap on the card itself.
